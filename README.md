•	Component data flow (passing data to child or sending emitted event to parent)
•	Router module
•	Typescript type checking
•	Lifecycle methods (used only ngOnInit for retrieving data)
•	Using services for global state and all logic
•	Simulation of retrieving JSON dummy data with HttpClientModule
•	Form Builder for handling forms
•	Pipes (async, uppercase)
•	CRUD requests (get, put, post, delete)
•	Usage of HttpClientInMemoryWebApiModule and InMemoryDataService for simulation of server
